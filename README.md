## What's this?
Part 1 of my exam in PGR202 Android Development at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania in the Spring of 2019. 
The task was to create an Android app where you could play Tic Tac Toe against a friend, or your phone.

The exam had some clear guidelines which you can read more about in "PGR202 - Exam.pdf"

## Comments
Being the first Android app I have ever developed, I'm quite proud of the result. 
Super TTT is written in Kotlin (which is Java, but much more logical). 
The code itself is not the best, since I have been focusing on creating the best possible user experience.
